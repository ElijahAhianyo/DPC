### Installation

We use python 3.6, pytorch 1.0.1, torchvision 0.2.2. 

The repo also requires cv2 (`conda install -c menpo opencv`), tensorboardX (`pip install tensorboardX`), joblib, tqdm, ipdb

### Prepare data

Follow the instructions [here](process_data/).

### Self-supervised training (DPC)

### Evaluation: supervised action classification

### DPC-pretrained weights
